Welcome to the Mokon Software Project Estimator (4). This program is a tool for
estimating elements of a software project.

At this current time there are only some tools for using the COCOMO (1) and
COCOMO II (2) models for estimating how much it would cost to develop a program.
This really is only a header file that must be included in a program similar to
the demo program given. This program you create will set up some various factors
in the COCOMO II model and use the COCOMO II class. At some point down the line
I hope to make this into a proper program you install and which takes a
configuration file to compute information on your project.

src/COCOMOII.hpp... This header file contains the COCOMOII algorithm in the form
...................   of the COCOMOII class.
src/Demo.cpp....... This source file contains a simple program which shows you
...................   how to use the COCOMOII class.
demo_report.cpp.... This script shows you an example way to use the demo program
...................   to print information about your project. You can use this
...................   as the basis for a script in your own program. In
...................   particular this script used the UCC program (3) to count
...................   lines of code in the project.


To build this program you need autotools. In general on Fedora if you need to
install these run:
  yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
If you are on a different distro it shouldn't be too hard to find out how to do
this.

One you do that the build process is standard autotools. Do a:
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make install
The standard autotools options are supported.
