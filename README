Welcome to the Mokon Software Project Estimator (4). This program is a tool for
estimating elements of a software project.

This package has some tools for using the COCOMO (1) and COCOMO II (2) models
for estimating how much it would cost to develop a program. This contains a
header file and a simple api program to be run with the given script.
This program you create will set up some various factors in the COCOMO II model
and use the COCOMO II class. At some point I may make the api program take the
COCOMMII options as input so more than the generic team options presented are
available.

src/COCOMOII.hpp.... This header file contains the COCOMOII algorithm in the
....................   form of the COCOMOII class.
src/COCOMOIIApi.cpp. This source file contains a simple program which shows you
....................   how to use the COCOMOII class. For more info it can be
....................   run with the command 'mspe --usage'.
src/mspe_report..... This script shows you an example way to use the api program
....................   to print information about your project. You can use this
....................   as the basis for a script in your own program. In
....................   particular this script used the UCC (3) and sloccount(5)
....................   programs to count the lines of code in the project.


To build this program you need autotools. In general on Fedora if you need to
install these run:
  yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
If you are on a different distro it shouldn't be too hard to find out how to do
this.

One you do that the build process is standard autotools. To build and install:
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make install
The standard autotools options are supported.

This software is licensed under the MIT License. For the text of this license
see the file called LICENSE.

The associated mspe_report script requires UCC and sloccount.

To install sloccount on fedora:
  yum install sloccount.x86_64 

To install UCC you will have to jump through some hoops. First you need to sign
up on their webpage(3) after which you can download a zip with the source code
for UCC. extract that and enter the ucc folder. type make. This will create a
file bin/UCC. There is no install command so this will have to be done manually.
